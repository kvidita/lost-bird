  objective 1 completed
  objective 2 - part 1 and part 2 completed

new updates
 [*] add a feature if cordinate matches with nest show win message
 [] make it to domain level 
 [] bird doesn't know about the previous position the logic should be outside the class
 [] small problem to think -
     make a small grid 
 [] Remove the commas with empty spaces

feedback: 
[1] space can be an object and bird, nest and bomb can be entries
[2] breakdown into small functions so that parameters passed are less
[3] read documentations for stdin
[4] cursor hide, screen resolution, clear screen down
[5] identify the entities and extract them
[6] apply new concepts when learned as we progress
