main Objective => to move the bird to it's nest.

1st Objective
  1.Make a grid
  2.Display the grid
  3.Hardcode a star as a bird inside the grid
  
2nd Objective

  [*]2.Add upward and downward movement.
  [*]3.Stop bird once it reaches its nest.

day1
  objective 1 completed
  objective 2 - part 1 and part 2 completed 
  moved bird automatically
  also moved the bird by using 'w' and 's'

Issues
  [*]  bird not stopping in last column when space is over
  [*]  bird going outside the grid and throwing errors.
  [*]  bird's icon remaining in the previous coordinates.
  [*]  standardInput for navigation

solutions
    -lower extreme coordinates  = (0, 0);
    -higher extreme coordinates = given;
    -keep track of last coordinates of bird.

new updates
 [*] add a feature if cordinate matches with nest show win message
 [] make it to domain level 
 [] bird doesn't know about the previous position the logic should be outside the class
 [] small problem to think -
     make a small grid 
 [] Remove the commas with empty spaces

 [*] move functions to respective files`
 [*] class methods to improve and remove all logics from class methods

 [] We want to implement obstacles
